# Control of Dynamic Parkour Motions for a Hopping Leg on a Broomstick

This repository functions as an annex to my Master's thesis, offering supplementary materials. However, it is not intended for ongoing developmental activities.
Contained within are videos capturing the conclusive experiments and the software that was devised. Given the code's reliance on internal DFKI packages, creating a publicly accessible installation guide is not a feasible endeavor.

### STRUCTURE

This repository consists of three main folders.

- `model`

  Files for modelling the robot

- `software`

  Python files containing the developed code

- `videos`
  
  Video footage of the experiments discussed in the thesis


### VIDEOS

The videos are labeled identically to the corresponding sections within the thesis where their discussions take place. Furthermore, the video titled 'Parkour Compilation' provides a comprehensive overview of all three experiments, along with detailed close-ups showcasing the traversal of each obstacle within the multiple obstacle parkour.


### NOTES

I recommend downloading the video folder exclusively to your local PC. These videos should be consulted while reading the discussion of the corresponding experiments. The original recordings are in 4k quality, which is why compressed files have been provided here. If you're keen on obtaining the recordings in their high-resolution format or if you have any inquiries, please don't hesitate to reach out via maxalbracht@gmail.com. Your interest and engagement are greatly appreciated.

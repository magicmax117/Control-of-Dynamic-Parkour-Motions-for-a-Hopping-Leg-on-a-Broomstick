# Control of Dynamic Parkour Motions for a Hopping Leg on a Broomstick

This repositoy serves as an appendix to my Masterthesis. It is not an active repository for future development.
Provided is video footage of the final experiments and the developed software.
Since the code is dependent on DFKI intern packages, a public installation guide is not reasonable.

### STRUCTURE

This repository consists of three main folders.

- `model`

  Files for modelling the robot

- `software`

  Python files containing the developed code

- `videos`
  
  Video footage of the experiments discussed in the thesis


### VIDEOS

The videos are named the same as the thesis section in which they are discussed. Additionally the video 'Parkour Compilation' shows a compilation of all three experiments as well as close ups of each obstacle traversal in the multiple obstacle parkour.

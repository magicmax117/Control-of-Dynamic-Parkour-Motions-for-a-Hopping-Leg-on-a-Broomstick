# Control of Dynamic Parkour Motions for a Hopping Leg on a Broomstick

This repositoy serves as an appendix to my Masterthesis. It provides video footage of the final experiments and the developed software.
Since the code is dependent on DFKI intern packages, a public installation guide is not reasonable. As soon as those packages are open sourced, this repository will be updated with a detailed installation guide.

If you are the new maintainer of the project, please check the [introduction to the project](https://git.hb.dfki.de/underactuated-robotics/hopping_leg/-/blob/master/docs/introduction/INTRODUCTION.md)

### STRUCTURE

This repository consists of three main folders.

- `videos`
  
  Video footage of the experiments discussed in the thesis

- `model`

  Files for modelling the robot
